Knytt R
=======

I really really like Nifflas' game [Knytt Stories](http://nifflas.ni2.se/?page=Knytt+Stories) (and all his old games, from before he adopted that cruddy silhouette artstyle).

But it's got some limitations and problems. It's got a rather tiny fixed screen size, and no scrolling. It's pretty much impossible to modify in order to fix these issues because the game was made in Multimedia Fusion 2, and relies upon third party libraries which are no longer hosted anywhere.

So I'm going to remake the game.

To-do
-----

* Basic game stuff
* ~~Steal~~ Liberate the KS art assets
* Tilemap level format (.knr.bin) and editor
* Maybe make compatible with existing .knytt.bin levels (gonna be hard)
